# RPManager ![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/blurry16/RPManager-mineflayer/master?label=last%20commit%20to%20master)

This is Mineflayer-edition of [RPManager](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager), originally developed using keyboard library in Python.
I don't know why I created this, though.  

## Requirements

First install Nodejs, then install [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/):

```bash
npm install mineflayer
```

After, change config values to your ones and run:

```bash
node main.js
```
