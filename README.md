# RPManager ![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/blurry16/RPManager-mineflayer/master?label=last%20commit%20to%20master)

This is Mineflayer-edition of [RPManager](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager), originally developed using the
keyboard library in Python.
I don't know why I created this, though.

## Requirements

First install Node.js, then install [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/):

```bash
npm install mineflayer
```

After, change the config file (by default `config.json`) values to your ones and run:

```bash
node main.js
```

### Additional requirements

RPManager supports [Prismarine Viewer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer). In order to use it, you need to change the `"use-prismarine-viewer"` value at the config file to `true` and the `"prismarine-viewer-port"` value to your one, or keep the default `3000`.  

**Don't forget to install the prismarine-viewer package:**

```bash
npm install prismarine-viewer
```

### RPManager is usable without Prismarine Viewer!

## Important notes

Check out [the Python version of RPManager](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager).

This is not exactly what the Python version is.
The Python version is much more complex,
it has more commands, but because I don't find why I would ever need them, they were not ported.

**I've never used it on Cubeville.
Yet.
If you want to try it, I recommend you to ask staff.
It doesn't even matter on
what server you're playing.**

See [command manual page](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager-mineflayer/blob/master/MAN.md).

If I ever updated this, I would organize code and make it look like I did
in [Python](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager).
I don't know JS, though.
