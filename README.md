# RPManager ![GitHub last commit (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/blurry16/RPManager-mineflayer/master?label=last%20commit%20to%20master)

This is Mineflayer-edition of [RPManager](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager), originally developed using keyboard library in Python.
I don't know why I created this, though.  

## Requirements

First install Nodejs, then install [Mineflayer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/):

```bash
npm install mineflayer
```

After, change `config.json` values to your ones and run:

```bash
node main.js
```

## Important notes

Check out [the Python version of RPManager](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager).  

This is not exactly what Python version was. Python version is much more complex, it has more commands but because I don't find why would I ever need them, they were not ported.  

I've never used it on Cubeville. Yet. If you want to try it, I recommend you to ask staff. It doesn't even matter on what server you're playing.

See [command manual page](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager-mineflayer/blob/master/MAN.md).

If I will ever update this, I would organize code and make it looking like I did in [Python](https://github.com/blurry16/RPManager). I don't know JS, though.
